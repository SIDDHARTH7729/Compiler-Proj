This is a simple compiler created using Bison and Flex. It supports basic arithmetic operations and variable assignments.
Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have the following tools installed:

    Bison: A parser generator for C. It is used to generate the parser code from a .y file.

        Install Bison (Ubuntu):

    sudo apt-get install bison

Flex: A tool for generating lexical analyzers (scanners) from a .l file.

    Install Flex (Ubuntu):

    sudo apt-get install flex

GCC: The GNU Compiler Collection, used to compile the project.

    Install GCC (Ubuntu):

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

Git: To clone the repository and manage version control.

    Install Git (Ubuntu):

        sudo apt-get install git

    (Optional) VS Code: If you're using Visual Studio Code for development.

        Install VS Code: Download here.

    (Optional) WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if you're using Windows. It is recommended for a seamless Linux-like environment on Windows.

        Install WSL (Windows): Install WSL.

How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Compiler-Proj.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

cd Compiler-Proj

3. Build the Project

Use the make command to build the project:

make

4. Run the Compiler

After building the project, you can run the compiler with an input file, such as sample.txt:

./compiler < sample.txt

Make sure the sample.txt file is in the root directory and contains valid input for the compiler to parse.
Example Input (sample.txt)

Hereâ€™s an example of what your input file (sample.txt) might look like:

a = 10;
b = 20;
c = a + b * 2;
print c;

This will output:

Result: 50
